    Create a function that uses yesterdayâ€™s partition to fully sort an array
    in-place.
    Unstable sort.

    Time Complexity
    - Best: O(n log(n)) linearithmic.
    - Average: O(n log(n)) linearithmic.
    - Worst: O(n^2) quadratic.

    Space: O(1) constant.
    Params: nums, left, right
    - left and right are indexes, for now, left will be 0, and right will be the
    last idx.
    - later these params will be used to specify a sub section of the array to
    partition.
    Steps:
    - start by partitioning the full array
    (use the previously built partition algo).
    - then partition the left side of the array
    (left of the returned partition idx) and the right side
    (right of the returned partition idx), recursively.

function partition(nums, leftIdx = 0, rightIdx = nums.length - 1) {
    const midIdx = Math.floor((leftIdx + rightIdx) / 2);
    const pivotValue = nums[midIdx];
    const tempPivotIdx = rightIdx;
  
    // Swap the pivot to the end of the section being partitioned so its
    // position can be kept track of, then move it last to its final position.
    [nums[midIdx], nums[tempPivotIdx]] = [nums[tempPivotIdx], nums[midIdx]];
  
    // Skip over the pivot that was moved to the end so it stays there for now.
    rightIdx = tempPivotIdx - 1;
  
    // Look for a num on the left and on the right that both need to be moved to
    // the other side so one swap can move both of them to the correct side.
    while (true) {
      // Move leftIdx until we find a num that is out of place.
      while (nums[leftIdx] < pivotValue) {
        leftIdx += 1;
      }
  
      // Move rightIdx until we find a num that is out of place.
      while (nums[rightIdx] > pivotValue) {
        rightIdx -= 1;
      }
  
      // All nums have been iterated over, partitioning is complete.
      if (leftIdx >= rightIdx) {
        // Swap the pivot to it's final location.
        [nums[tempPivotIdx], nums[leftIdx]] = [nums[leftIdx], nums[tempPivotIdx]];
        return leftIdx;
      }
  
      // Swap the two out of place nums so they will both be on the correct side.
      [nums[leftIdx], nums[rightIdx]] = [nums[rightIdx], nums[leftIdx]];
  
      // After swapping, we're done with this pair, move on.
      leftIdx += 1;
      rightIdx -= 1;
    }
